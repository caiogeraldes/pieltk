# pieltk (proto-indo-european toolkit)

This project is an extension of [pieoffice](https://github.com/caiogeraldes/pieoffice),
built with the [cltk](https://github.com/cltk/cltk) as model.

Some of the tools included in this project are part of my research with the
[GELIA-USP (Grupo de Estudos de LÃ­nguas Indo-Europeais Antigas)](https://geliea.fflch.usp.br/).

## TODOs

- Finish the Armenian Syllabify tool:
    - Include *proper* criteria of syllabification.
    - Include an option to add the *schwa* in sequences of consonants.
- Padronize the converter tools for most languages.
- Include alphabet information for the languages supported by `pieoffice`. Currently supported:
    - Avestan `ave`
    - Carian `xcr` (Localities in development)
    - Classical Armenian `xcl`
    - Cypriot Syllabary `grc/cypriot`
    - Lycian `xlc`
    - Lydian `xld`
    - Old Persian `peo`
    - Oscan `osc`
